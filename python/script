Welcome to sfpc
'look around' to see what you can interact with
interactive objects are capitalized
interact with them by 'use ITEM'
for example type 'use sfpc' to begin.
awesome! welcome to sfpc
The story: 
you wake up in this room and have no idea how you got here
seems like you overslept, it's totally dark and quite cold.
looking around there is a DOOR, a TABLE and a LAMP.
There is a BOOK on the table. it doesn't look very interesting.
at the margin of the random page you popped open,
there is a poem someone written in this boring book
there is WISDOM on the lamp
you realized the way to end all these
There is a DOOR, LAMP and TABLE. The lamp is off.
you walked out the door and achieved nirvana! awesome!
